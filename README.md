# 🤖 RTTSSL - Real-Time Translation System for Sign Language

RTTSSL is a Python-based system designed to visually translate letters, words and gestures in real time.

## 💡 Features

- Real-time gesture recognition and translation
- Sign language letter and word detection
- Facial Recognition
- Model training capabilities
- Recording method for your translations

## 🔤 Requirements

- Python 3.8-3.11 (TensorFlow compatibility)
- Webcam
- Required packages listed in `requirements.txt`
- GPU is recommended for faster training

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JDs2019sk/RTTSSL.git
   cd RTTSSL
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 📚 Usage

1. Test your camera setup:

   ```bash
   python test_camera.py
   ```

2. Train the gesture recognition model:

   ```bash
   python -m src.gesture.model_trainer
   ```

See [Training file](docs/TRAINING.md) for detailed training instructions.

3. Run the main program:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
